# Project Details

The application, developed using Spring Boot, represents prices through a model class called `Price`. These prices are listed, accessed and updated through `PriceController`. 
The user interface is created with Thymeleaf templates, and styling and dynamic coloring features are provided with `style.css` and `price.js` files. 
Database operations are performed through the `PriceRepository` and `PriceService` classes. 
This project is also one of the best examples to demonstrate the use of basic CRUD (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`) operations.
